I
dont
mean
to
please
grand
people
With
love
friends
notions
Id
rate
And
give
you
all
that
could
scribble
As
pawn
thats
worth
of
dear
mate
Its

of
fine
and
charming
soul
Of
saint
fulfilled
generous
dreams
Of
lively
lucid
verses
glow
Of
lofty
thoughts
of
simple
things
All
right
by
hand
unfair
own
You
take
my
set
of
florid
rhymes
Which
are
halffunny
and
halfmournful
Of
common
thinking
somewhat
thoughtful
Slipshod
result
of
my
pastimes
Of
sleepless
nights
of
inspirations
Of
years
young
but
whithered
hard
Of

some
cold
observations
Of
grievous
notes
of
the

CHAPTER
ONE
He
hurries
up
to
live
As
well
as
he
does
to
feel
K
Vyasemsky
I
I
My
uncle
keeps
to
honest
systems
By
falling
ill
yet
not
in
jest
He
made
me
love
him
with
insistence
And
couldnt
find
some
better
test
Well
his
example
gives
a
lesson
But
goodness
me
its
quite
distressing
To
sit
with
him
all
day
and
night
Not
stepping
out
of
his
sight
And
what
insidiousness
you
show
When
you
amuse
a
man
half
dead
Arrange
the
pillows
in
bed
Then
give
him
drugs
in
sadness
though
You
sigh
not
speaking
of
your
will
When
will
the
devil
come
for
him
II

The
young
scapegrace
was
so
deeming
When
he
by
postchaise
in
dust
Was
shaking
Due
to
Zues
hes
being
The
heir
of
all
relatives
in
trust
Ruslans
Lyudmilas
friends
Somehow
Without
prefaces
just
now
For
hero
of
my
book
Let
me
attract
attentive
look
Onegin
friend
of
mine
for
years
Was
born
on
Nevarivers
banks
May
be
you
rose
from
the
clans
In
those
places
or
have
dears
Somewhere
you
could
look
at
me
But
harmful
is
the
North
for
me

His
father
served
for
many
years
And
fell
in
debt
such
big
and
vast
That
giving
balls
three
times
a
year
He
squandered
all
he
had
at
last
But
Eugenes
fate
for
him
was
fair
At
first
by
Madame
he
was
cared
Madame
But
then
a
frenchman
took
her
place
Monsieur
The
boy
was
frisky
but
with
grace
Monsieur
lAbbe
a
Frenchman
mere
To
give
the
boy
some
chance
to
rest
Monsieur
l'Abb
Was
teaching
him
with
ready
jest
With
morals
never
was
severe
For
pranks
reproved
with
gentle
talks
To
Summer
Garden
took
for
walks
IV

Insurgent
youth
is
not
yet
endless
When
Eugene
was
to
change
his
sort
In
times
of
hopes
tender
sadness
Monsieur
was
driven
from
the
court
Monsieur
Onegins
now
free
from
care
In
fashion
has
he
cut
his
hair
Like
London
dandy
well
arrayed
First
coming
to
the
world
he
made
dandy
His
French
was
so
perfect
now
That
he
could
chat
as
well
as
write
He
was
in
dances
quick
and
light
Without
tension
he
could
bow
What
more
you
want
The
world
said
why
He
is
a
clever
pretty
guy

We
all
to
learn
had
little
go
And
anyhow
something

With
education

you
know
We

bless

God
Onegin
was
in
eyes
of
people
Which
were
in
judgements
strict
not
feeble
A
pedant
but
of
science
man
He
had
a
happy
talent
then
He
was
enabled
slightly
rushing
To
speak
of
anything
at
once
As
real
expert
does
by
chance
He
could
be
silent
in
discussion
His
epigrams
unwaited
file
Could
make
all
pretty
ladies
smile
VI
VI
But
Latins
not
in
fashion
now
To
tell
the
truth
but
frank
enough
He
knew
the
Latin
anyhow
To
talk
about
epigraf
Of
Jouvenale
to
talk
much
better
To
end
with
vale
own
letter
vale
Remembered
though
with
mistakes
Two
little
verses
of
Enaids
He
never
wished
to
rummage
quickly
In
chronological
thick
dust
Of
writings
of
the
life
in
past
But
ancient
anecdotes
deeply
From
Romul
to
the
present
day
In
depth
of
mind
he
kept
away
VII

Not
having
any
higher
passion
To
rhymes
to
dedicate
his
life
Iambus
he
at
frank
confession
From
trochee
couldnt
tell
meanwhile
Feocrite
Gomer
were
reproved
Yet
Adam
Smith
was
well
approved
In
housekeeping
he
was
best
Arid
any
problems
put
to
test
Of
how
state
itself
enriches
And
how
lives
which
way
and
why
Without
gold
can
revive
While
simple
product
is
its
richness
His
father
didnt
understand
Arid
put
in
pledge
the
whole
land
YIII
VIII
To
tell
you
all
what
he
had
known
I
havent
any
time
at
all
His
genius
was
unique
alone
He
knew
of
something
best
of
all
Which
was
for
him
from
time
of
childhood
Like
work
and
torment
was
delightful
Which
pressed
his
spirits
all
the
way
And
kept
his
laziness
for
day
It
was
the
art
of
tender
passion
By
Nazon
brightly
glorified
But
Nazon
was
by
world
denied
And
suffered
past
rebellious

far

From

From
early
times
he
was
dissembling
Some
hidden
hope
he
could
leave
He
pined
away
he
was
dissuading
Was
dull
and
jealous
made
believe
Could
come
such
proud
or
obedient
Could
be
attentive
or
indifferent
Was
languishing
and
taciturn
Eloquent
ardently
in
turn
In
hearty
letter
as
its
sender
He
was
slipshod
For
all
of
that
Of
own
life
he
could
forget
His
look
was
always
quick
and
tender
Was
impudent
and
shy
sometimes
Could
show
how
tear
shines
XI

Was
seeming
new
on
each
occasion
With
jokes
innocence
amazed
Could
give
a
fright
by
desperation
With
flattery
could
draw
ones
gaze
Was
able
any
glimpse
of
sweetness
Of
vergin
years
bias
giftness
With
passion
and
the
wit
to
gain
For
sudden
tenderness
to
wait
For
words
of
love
to
be
entreating
First
move
of
heart
to
catch
by
chance
To
chase
the
love
and
all
at
once
To
get
agreed
a
secret
meeting
And
then
from
people
far
away
To
give
her
lessons
all
the
day
XII

And
how
could
he
be
annoying
The
hearts
of
ladies
whom
he
knew
But
when
his
thoughts
were
of
destroying
His
own
rivals
though
few
His
scandal
talks
were
such
backbiting
His
nets
for
them
were
so
frightening
But
blissful
husband
of
coquette
To
part
from
him
you
did
regret
By
cunning
husband
he
was
greeted
Of
Faublas

By

In

lose

Its

Oh
you

so
honoured
To

Ill
give

forward

keep

like
anew

warn
all
you
You
mothers
should
be
more
severe
While
looking
after
girls
and
yet
At
them
keep
strictly
your
lornette
If

Alas

ruined

if

never
shifted

love
to
ballets
could
survive
I
like
teenages
lively
madness
The
tightness
brightness
and
the
gladness
Of
ladies
wellconsidered
dress
I
love
girls
feet
But
its
a
stress
To
try
to
find
in
Russia
whole
Of
them
three
pairs
straight
and
fine
Ah
Ill
forever
keep
in
mind
Small
feet

Sad

cold

them

They
trouble

In

how
You
madman

feet
such

where

you
flow
What
vernal
plants
are
trampling
yet
In
eastern
comfort
being
cherished
Sad
northern
snow
to
embellish
You
never
stamped
your
small
footprints
You
liked
smooth
carperts

prints
To
touch
in
splendid
admiration
Is
it
high
time
as
I
forgot
For
you
the
glory

the
laud
The

land
incarceration

happiness

has
gone
Like

Reward
which
I
cant

appraising
Conditionally
by

Selfwilled

Nothing
hinders
To
love
it
under

cloth
In

I
keep
in

the
sea
quite
stormy
What
envious
I
was
when
waves
In
turn
to
girl
were
all
returning
With
love
to
feet
to
lay
themselves
With
waves
I
wished
myself
somehow
To
touch
her
dear
feet
by
mouth
Among
all
those
ardent
days
Of
boiling
youth
such
bright
and
gay
I
never
wished
with
such
a
torture
To
kiss
young
Armids
pretty
lips
Or
roses
of
flaming
cheeks
Or
bosom
which

yawning

Prepared
for

In

babble
of
still
streams
On
third
day
looking
all

In
other

book
A
jug

took

Among
his
properties
alone
To
pass
away
his
lazy
time
He
wanted
to
establish
own
In
orders
newer
fashioned
line
In
countrys
place
the
man
of
wisdom
He
gave
his
serfs
a
piece
of
freedom
The
corvee
yoke
changed
for
rate
And
serfs
were
blessing
their
fate
For
that
a
neighbour
in
his
farming
Was
puffing
up
to
his
big
farm
He
saw
in
it
some
dreadful
harm
The
other
smiled
but
smile
was
cunning
And
they
expressed
the
common
wish
To
call
him
dangerous
queer
fish

At
first
they
came
to
him
for
visit
But
as
he
usually
was
gone
For
him
to
hide
was
very
easy
By
riding
stallion
from
the
Don
When
suddenly
from
village
rear
He
could
some
droshkys
sounds
hear
Such
acts
insulted
neighbours
all
They
stopped
to
come
to
him
at

Hes

neighbours
He
is
freethinker
drinks
red
wine
From

not

For

Says

Or

warmed

puzzled
over

In

could

He
did
believe
that
soul
dear
Will
join
enevitably
him
That
she
delightless
in
the
near
Is
daily
waiting
just
for
him
And
he
was
sure
friends
are
ready
To
suffer
all
for
him
already
Will
never
tremble
their
hand
To
beat
the
slander
off
a
man
That
there
are
by
fate
selected
Of
people
dear
sacred
friends
That
their
friendship
never
ends
By
unreflected
rays
effected
It
will
sometime
all

illume
Will
gift

some
blessed
perfume

Regret
resentment
being
sorry
Some
pure
love
to
every
boon
Some
sweetish
torture
of
the
glory
His
blood
excited
very
soon
With
lyre
while
abroad
residing
In
Goethes
Shiners
places
hiking
By
their
poetic
light
He
own
soul
did
ignite
Of
art
high
muses
fine
impressions
He
happy
never
put
to
shame
In
songs
could
proudly
retain
For
all
his
life
exalted
passions
And
impulses
of
virgin
dream
And
grand
simplicity
in
him
X

He
sang
of
love
for
love
was
loyal
His
song
was
clear
like
the
noon
Like
thoughts
of
simple
ladys
soul
Like
dreams
of
child
or
like
the
moon
In
deserts
of
the
heavens
districts
The
goddess
of
the
sighs
and
secrets
He
sang
of
partings
and
of
griefs
Of
something
foggy
misbeliefs
And
of
romantic
finest
rose
He
sang
of
countries
far
away
In
them
in
stillness
of
the
day
He
real
tears
could
expose
He
sang
of
how
life
could
fade
All
that
in
his
teenage
he
made
XI

The
one
was
Eugene
in
these
deserts
Who
could
evaluate
his
gifts
But
landlords
of
the
countrys
peasants
Were
never
liked
by
him
at
feasts
The
noisy
talks
he
was
escaping
All
their
prudent
talk
such
raving
About
haying
and
of
wine
Of
kennels
of
relations
lint
Could
never
show
shining
passion
Nor
sparks
of
poetic
light
Nor
sharpness
nor
some
sign
of
mind
Nor
of
communal
life
succession
But
talk
of
their
dear
wives
By
absent
wit
him
always
strikes
XII

Hes
handsome
rich
of
fair
manner
And
neighbours
said
he
needs
a
bride
Such
customs
known
everywhere
To
marry
daughters
every
tried
To
have
halfRussian
neighbour
dear
As
quickly
as
he
can
appear
They
speak
to
him
of
no
more
But
being
bachelor
is
bore
Him
call
to
sit
to
samovar
And
Doonya
quickly
gives
him
tea
They
whisper
her
You
Doonya
see
Then
bring
to
Doonya
some
guitar
And
she
is
squeaking

In

But
Lensky
having
no
wishes
Of

ties
the
weight
to
have
To
Eugene
sent
his
hearty
greetings
Some
hints
on
nearness
he
gave
They
friends
became
But
wave
and
stone
The
ice
and
flame
the
verse
and
prose
Have
less
in
difference
between
Each

At
first
theyd
nothing
seen
In

Then
they
estimated
Each
one
another
daily
forth
They
met
each

And
then
became

men
Im
first
of
them
to
blame
From

We

wishes
But
millions
of
the
twolegged
creatures
For
us
are
only
some
tools
And
all

are

But
Eugene
was
beyond
conception
Of
course
he
knew
the
people
well
In
general
he
gave
them
hell
But
any
rule
has
some
exception
He
differed
people
in
effect
And
others
passions
could
respect
XV

To
Lensky
he
could
listen
smiling
His
ardent
talk
was
full
of
haze
His
wit
of
poet
was
milding
His
constantly
inspired
faze
He
tried
his
cooling
word
to
own
To
keep
away
from
man
like
this
He
thought
a
fool
would
trouble
his
Such
quickly
fading
high
affection
Without
me
his
time
will
come
But
now
let
him
live
in
calm
And
great
belief
in
worlds
perfection
Forgive
him
ardour
of
his
age
Of
young
delirium
high
rage

Each

argued
at
the

To
meditate
they
were
in
mood
On
real
price
of
ancient
treaties
On
evil

on
science
fruit
On
old
prejudices
harmful
Eternal
secret
tombs
alarmful
The
fate
and
life
in
their
turn
To
their
judgement
could
return
The
poet
in
heat
of
judgement
Some
nothern
poem
could
cite
As
if
to
prove
that
he
was
right
And
Eugene
passionate
indulgent
Who
understood
it
wee
a
hit
All
his
attention
paid
to
it
XVII

But
often
passions
were
invading
The
mind
of
hermits
of
my
men
Of
passions
press
at
last
escaping
Again
Onegin
said
of
them
Unwillingly
with
sighs
of
pity
Hes
blessed
who
knew
all
their
pretty
Effects
but
stepped
away
anew
Hes
blessed
much
more
who
never
knew
The
love
who
cooled
it
with
divorcement
By
scandal
enmity
could
strand
And
yawned
with
happy
wife
and
friend
Not
troubled
by
the
jealous
torment
Who
fathers
money
never
trusts
To
cunning
friends
to
crufty

When
we
shall
gather
under
banner
Of
stillness
rational
and
cairn
When
well
have
cooled
the
passions
temper
And
no
more
they
would
alarm
All
us
well
laugh
at
their
impulse
At
late
ridiculous
opinions
Then
well
submissively
obey
To
hear
stories
by
the
way
About
others
restless
passions
And
others
love
will
touch
the
heart
Well
be
like
invalid
in
hut
Who
nears
ears
to
confessions
Of
boasting
moustached

Who
conquered

But
all
the
youngsters
always
flaming
Could
never
enmity
conceal
The
sadness
gladness
love
inflaming
They
all
were
ready
to
reveal
Onegin
no
love
could
hook
in
But
listened
with
a
pompous
lookin
To
Lensky
speaking
of
himself
Revealing
all
his
heart
itself
His
conscience
Lensky
was
revealing
His
own
soul
criticized
Onegin
quickly
recognized
The
talk
of
love
which
was
fulfilling
With
many
senses
all
this
fuss
Which
is
antique
for
all
of
us

Ah
he
could
love
they
dont
now
Have
anything
like
real
love
Of
poet
whos
anyhow
Convicted
to
the
truthful
love
One
vision
always
everywhere
The
rime
desire
comes
to
dare
To
comfort
sorrow
and
grief
And
nothing
cooled
his
strong
belief
Nor
longest
years
of
the
partings
Nor
all
to
muses
given
time
Nor
foreign
beauties
so
fine
Nor
sciences
nor

Could
change
his
soul
little
bit
Some
virgin
fire
flamed
in
it
XXI

Yet
child
by
Olga
fascinated
Ignorant
yet
of
hearty

He
touching

captivated
By

prettiness

In

protective
He
was

her

effective
And
parents
foresaw
the
fate
Were
calculating
wedding

In
stillness
of
the
humble
grove
Of
innocence
some

She

could
bloom
Like

To

First
moan

But
you
forgive

He
liked
the

timid
thickness
He
liked
the
stillness
lone

The
night
the
stars
the
round
moon
The
moon
this
miracle
in
heavens
To
which
we
dedicated
nights
At
meetings
but
without
lights
And
tears
secret
torments
gladness
But
now

for
us
Is
mere
lantern

Shes
dutiful

As
fresh

The

The

never

For

it
all
seemed
wrong
Yet
being

play

had
none

at

To

looked

felt

hadnt

And
calmly

The
novels
were
for
many
years
Her
inner
life
were
liked
by
her
She
loved
the
fraud
about
fears
Of
Richardson
and
by
Rousseau
Her
father
was
goodhumoured
being
From
age
retarted
Scornful
feeling
He
had
of
books
as
no
harm
In
them
he
saw
but
no
charm
Could
grasp
in
idle
futile
reading
Was
not
concerned
a
little
bit
Of
what
the
secret
book
she
hid
In
daughters
bed
till
day
was
dreaming
His
wife
herself
such
feeling
had
From
Richardson
to
be
quite
mad
XXX

She
liked
the
books
of
Richardson
Yet
no
because
them
all
she
read
And
not
because
the
Grandison
To
Lovelace
was
by
her
prefered
It
was
because
of
cousin
dear
In
Moscow
princess
Alina
Was
talking
much
of
them
with
pride
For
husband
then
she
was
yet
bride
But
being
wife
she
willynilly
Yet
sighed
for
man
of
other
kind
Who
pleased
her
soul
and
the
mind
Much
more
was
touching
all
her
feeling
Good
guy
and
sergeant
of
the
guards
This
Grandison
could
play
the
cards

Like
he
she
was
welldressed
in
fashion
In
best
attires
every
day
But
soon
not
asked
for
her
concession
Was
to
the
altar
led
away
To
dissipate
her
greatest
woe
Judicious
husband
had
a
go
To
village
own
took
her
soon
But
she
was
often
in
a
fume
Some
days
was
crying
then
was
trying
To
get
divorce
from
newly
man
But
soon
to
farming
she
began
To
be
accustomed
and
relying
By
us
the
habits
have
been
got
Instead
of
happiness
from
God
XXXII

The
habits
sugared
all
her
woe
Which
wasnt
smoothed
by
any
chance
But
soon
she
all
was
full
of
go
By
it
she
calmed
herself
at
once
Between
affairs
and
the
leisure
She
found
out
with
a
pleasure
The
way
to
keep
her
man
away
And
everything
became
okey
She
was
the
works
in
fields
observing
She
salted
mushrooms
punished
men
She
kept
accounts
always
then
On
Saturdays
they
bath
were
serving
Sometimes
she
beat
a
housemaid
All
that
not
asking
man
she
made
XXXIII

Sometimes
with
own
blood
she
wrote
To
ladys
album
if
by
chance
Then
changed
in
strict
and
quick
a
mode
The
maidens
names
by
names
from
France
She
tried
her
corset
tight
to
wear
And
Russian
in
French
best
manner
N
Through
nose
singingly
could
say
But
soon
her
mood
could
pass
away
To
her
it
all
seemed
rather
queer
She
all
forgot
replaced
again
Each
name
from
France
by
Russian
name
Forgot
princess

dear
And
she
herself
renewed

last

Her
husbands
love
to
wife
was
hearty
Her
deeds
he
took
for
mere
crank
To
trust
his
wife
he
was
lighthearted
In
dressinggown
ate
and
drank
His
life
was
calm
without
woe
Sometimes
his
neighbours
in
his
home
Would
come
together
at
weekends
Unceremonious
dear
friends
To
grieve
to
talk
of
new
affairs
To
laugh
to
gossip
for
a
while
And
thus
the
time
would
pass
meanwhile
They
ask
and
Olga
tea
prepares
Then
supper
time
to
be
in
bed
And
soon
the
guests
all
home

They
kept
in
peaceful
life
some
customs
Of
dear
old
days
it
means
They
were
at
Shroveday
accustomed
To
have
the
fattest
Russian
blins
They
had
a
fasting
twice
a
year
They
liked
of
round
swing
high
gear
The
guessing
songs
and
round
dance
On
all
Whitsundays
caught
a
chance
While
people
yawn
in
church
at
prayer
To
find
a
bunch
of
praying
grass
And
drop
some
tears
twice
or
thrice
They
needed
kvass
not
less
than
air
At
table
each
of
dear
guests
Had
course
according
to
the
ranks
XXXVI

And
so
grew
they
old
both
But
soon
for
husband
all
at
once
The
door
of
coffin
was
unclosed
To
have
new
wreath
he
got
a

He
died

I
would
he
sorry
I
live
and
write
not
for
applause
But
seems
to
me
Id
wish
of
course
To
fill
my
fate
with
kind
of
glory
In
hope
that
by
future
friend
Of
me
some
sound
will
be
said
XL

The
heart
of
somebody
hell
cherish
Arid
kept
by
touch
of
truthful
fate
Perhaps
in
Lethe
wont
perish
My
verse
by
wit
and
heart
well
made
Perhaps
in
front
of
portrait
famous
To
people
future
ignoramous
Will
show
my
renowned
face
And
say
Its
poet
of
grace
Accept
you
all
my
thankful
feelings
Admirer
of
peaceful
muse
Ah
you
whose
memory
will
fuse
In
verse
my
flying
feeble
dealings
Whose
grateful
feeling
truthful
hand
Will
pat
the
fame
of

You

queer
Good

Onegin
time

gone
I
dont
hamper
you
but
dear
For
evenings
where
have
you
gone
To
Larins
Oh
looks
it
strangely
To
kill
your
pretty
evenings
daily
Forgive
me
isnt
it
too
hard
For
me
its
not
But
dear
bard
I
dont
grasp
despite
endeavours
You
listen
to
if
I
am
right
This
Russian
family
seems
light
To
all
the
guests
its
always
zealous
The
jams
eternal
talk
of
all
Of
rain
of
flax
of
horses

In
this
I
see
yet
no
troubles
But
trouble
is
they
are
such
bores
I
hate
your
world
of
fashion
marbles
Much
more
I
like
the
world
indoors
And
there
For
the
sake
of
goodness
You
keep
the
eclog
now
useless
Im
sorry
that
you
go
well
My
dear
Lensky
will
you
tell
If
that
Fillidae
you
can
show
The
subject
for
the
pen
to
mourn
For
tears
rhymes
and
so
on
Present

Dyou
joke
No
Im
glad
but
when
Well
now

They
will
receive
with
pleasure
us
III

Lets
go
They
were
quietly
driven
And
got
to
neighbours
in
a
while
At
once
they
heartily
were
given
All
services
of
old
time
It
was
well
known
friendly
wellcome
On
saucers
jam
they
gave
and
seldom
Some
berry
water
in
a
jug
Put
on
a
table
and
a
cup
IV

The
way
is
short
from
dear
neighbour
They
go
home
fast
at
speed
Lets
listen
yet
without
labour
To
their
talking
short
indeed
But
why
Onegin
you
are
yawning
My
habit
I
But
you
are
boring
Much
more
Well
no
just
the
same
The
field
is
dark
in
pretty
gale
Andryushka
quicker
must
you
go
What
foolish
dumpy
is
this
place
You
see
your
Larina
is
plain
But
very
dear
old
soul
And
Im
afraid
in
spite
of
charm
That
water
brings
me
much
of
harm
V

You
tell
of
them
which
is
Tatyana
That
girl
whichs
always
so
sad
Shes
taciturn
like
that
Swetlana
When
came
at
window
she
sat
But
do
you
love
indeed
the
other
And
what
But
Id
prefer
another
If
I
were
poet
like
you
Of
life
her
features
have
but
few
Like
in
van
Dicks
Madonna
finness
Her
face
is
round
red
shes
boon
As
well
as
ruddy
foolish
moon
At
the
horizons
foolish
brightness
Vladimir
answered
short
was
dry
Then
he
was
mute
his
face
was
wry

Meanwhile
Onegins
stay
at
Larins
Was
estimated
like
a
news
Affected
native
Russian
banns
And
all
the
neighbours
were
amused
They
all
began
to
guess
of
reasons
Invented
stealthily
decisions
They
joked
not
without
sin
At
Tanyas
suitor
made
a
hint
Some
neighbours
said
of
the
impression
That
wedding
had
some
pointed
time
But
was
delayed
for
short
a
while
As
they
had
no
rings
of
fashion
About
Lenskys
wedding
all
Were
sure
neighbours
once
for
all
VII

Tatyana
heard
with
indignation
All
those
gossips
but
she
had
With
unexpected
consolation
Unwittingly
some
thought
of
that
Some
string
of
love
in
her
appeared
In
love
affairs
she
was
geared
As
well
as
seeds
in
vital
strife
In
earth
by
spring
are
given
life
Long
since
the
girl
began
to
languish
Could
burn
in
bliss
in
dismal
mood
Her
spirit
longed
for
fatal
food
Long
since
unbearable
anguish
Made
all
young
heart
to
pine
away
For
someone
did
her
soul
wait
VIII

She
waited
looked
and
anyhow
She
said
well
yes
it
must
be
He
Alas
all
days
and
nights
are
now
One
long
and
lone
dream
in
heat
Alls
filled
by
Him
by
image
dear
And
magic
force
that
she
can
hear
Yet
speaks
of
Him
and
she
avoids
The
sounds
of
the
tender
voice
And
gaze
attentive
of
her
maidens
She
daily
greatly
is
depressed
She
doesnt
listen
to
the
guests
And
curses
their
idle
leisures
Unwaited
coming
any
day
And
each
delay
to
get
away
IX

And
now
she
with
great
attention
Voluptuous
novels
quickly
reads
With
what
a
lively
fascination
Deludes
herself
with
all
deceits
By
happy
force
of
own
dreamings
She
brings
to
life
all
novels
beings
Like
Julies
lovers
grand
Wollmar
MalekAdel
and
De
Linar
And
Vertcr
that
rebellious
martyr
Unimitable
Grandison
With
whom
we
all
to
sleep
had
gone
For
tender
girl
the
dreamer
hearty
In
single
image
they
confused
In
one
Onegin
all
were
fused
X

She
feels
herself
like
all
her
dear
Of
books
beloved
main
persons
feel
Clarissa
Julie
and
Delphina
Tatyana
in
the
forests
still
With
dangerous
book
alones
hiking
In
it
reveals
she
so
striking
Her
secret
heat
of
which
she
dreamt
Whose
plenitude
ih
heart
she
felt
She
sighs
assuming
as
her
real
Delights
of
others
and
the
griefs
Each
day
she
whispers
own
myths
Of
letter
to
her
image
dear
But
hero
Im
not
wrong
Could
never
be
like
Grandison
XI

His
style
to
pompous
tune
rerversing
An
ardent
author
tried
sometimes
To
show
his
beloved
main
person
As
perfect
one
for
all
the
times
And
gave
this
person
all
the
beauty
And
made
him
wrongly
persecuted
With
tender
soul
clear
sense
Him
gave
attractive
handsome
face
And
heated
by
the
pure
passion
This
agitated
person
bade
His
wish
to
sacrifice
his
fate
But
for
the
end
to
make
impression
Was
always
punished
wicked
vice
And
good
was
given
garlands
twice
XII

In
haze
are
now
minds
of
people
The
moral
them
to
sleep
just
makes
The
vice
thats
gentle
but
not
feeble
In
novels
now
celebrates
Of
British
muse
some
old
fables
Her
dreams
disturb
and
it
enables
As
idols
now
to
have
got
Or
Vampire

lost
in
thought

Melmoth

distressful
Or
Corsair

Or

Enveloped

But
dear
friends
it
all
is
useless
If
I
in
future
wont
be
A
poet
by
will
of
goodness
New
devil
then
will
enter
me
In
spite
of
Foebus
warning
notes
Myself
Ill
humble
to
the
prose
When
novels
in
the
old
ways
Will
take
the
twilight
of
my
days
Not
secret
tortures
of
the
evil
Would
I
in
prose
represent
But
simply
I
to
you
will
send
The
legends
of
the
Russian
real
Past
clans
the
charming
dreams
of
love
Antique
moralities
beloved
XIV

In
them
Ill
write
of
simple
speeches
Of
dad
of
uncle
old
man
Of
bold
childrens
secret
meetings
That
near
lime
at
brook
began
Of
partings
jealous
indignation
Of
tears
of
conciliation
Again
of
scandals
and
at
last
To
altar
I
shall
lead
them
fast
And
Ill
remind
the
speech
of
passion
The
words
of
longing
wistful
love
That
on
the
days
I
meant
above
At
feet
of
ladies
fox
expression
Of
feelings
quickly
came
to
mind
But
now
weakly
lag

Tatyana
ah
Tatyana
dear
With
you
I
now
tears
shed
Of
tyrant
you
didnt
fear
But
now
he
your
fate
has
had
Youll
perish
but
before
you
go
You
try
in
dazzling
pretty
hope
Some
darkling
blessing
to
invite
To
know
better
bliss
of
life
And
magic
poison
of
its
itches
You
are
pursued
by
happy
dream
At
any
place
you
fancy
him
The
refuge
for
the
happy
wishes
At
any
place
in
front
of
you
Your
fatal
tempter
waits
for
you

In
grief
of
love
Tatyana
goes
To
their
garden
she
is
sad
But
suddenly
her
eyelids
close
She
hasitates
to
make
a
step
Her
chest
is
high
her
cheeks
are
covered
By
instant
flame
they
quickly
flowered
The
breath
is
fading
in
her
lips
She
heard
some
noise
her
eyes
did
glimpse
The
night
then
comes
the
moon
is
mooving
Around
distant
parts
of
sky
A
nightingale
in
haze

His
loud
melodies
is
tuning
In
dark
my
Tanyas
quite
upset
With

cant
sleep
its

you
unclose
The
window
and
sit
beside
But
what
is
it
You
tell
of
those
Your
old
times
Ive
boring
tide
But
what
about
I
had
happened
To
know
many
old
legends
A
lot
of
stories
with
the
whirls
With
wicked
ghosts
and
the
girls
My
memory
is
dark
Im

Is
drawn

You

About

Ah
dear
my
in
my
teenager
We
heard
yet
nothing
of
the
love
Or
otherwise
Id
be
with
rages
By
all
my
kin
pursued
for
love
But
how
did
you
marry
nanny
It
was
by
wish
of
God
My
Vanny
Was
younger
than
myself
I
mean
And
I
was
dear
yet
thirteen
For
weeks
matchmaker
was
then
coming
To
all
my
kin
and
due
to
that
My
father
gave
consent
to
wed
In
fear
I
was
crying
darling
In
weep
my
plait
was
then
undid
With
songs
to
altar
us
could
lead
XIX

And
Im
in
family
unknown
But
are
you
listening
yet
to
me
Well
I
my
nanny
dont
know
For
love
Im
longing
dear
me
To
cry
to
weep
Im
now
ready
I
see
you
are
unwell
already
My
dear
God
you
bless
and
save
What
do
you
want
to
ask
you
say
But
let
me
help
with
sacred
water
You
are
in
heat
But
Im
not
ill
Well
nanny
Im
in
love
I
feel
God
bless
you
now
dear
daughter
The
nurse
was
using
own
way
To
help
the
girl
with
cross
and
pray
XX

I
fell
in
love
again
she
whispers
In
nurses
ear
in
dismay
My
hearty
friend
you
have
some
fevers
I
fell
in
love
youd
get
away
Meanwhile
the
moon
was
brightly
shining
By
languid
light
it
was
enlightning
Tatyanas
pale
and
dismal
charms
Her
hair
down
let
by
chance
The
tracks
of
tears
in
a
chair
In
front
of
heroine
in
grief
In
wadded
jacket
and
kerchief
The
old
woman
with
grey
hair
And
all
around
dreams
in
still
With
light
of
moon
its
all
fulfilled

While
at
the

Tatyanas
looking
By
own
heart
away
shes
gone
Of
mind
some
vague
a
thought
is
moving
You
nanny
let
me
stay
forlone
You
give
a
pen
and
paper
dear
Ill
stay
in
bed
make
table
near
Forgive
me
Lone
in
the
room
In
stillness
in
the
light
of
moon
Shes
writing
on
the
table
leaning
And
always
Eugenes
kept
in
mind
Her
letter
of
unwitting
kind
By
love
of
innocence
is
breathing
The
letters
ready
has
been
fit
Tatyana
tell
for
whom

I
knew
some
difficult
young
ladies'
Like
winter
cold
pure
light
Implacable
at
their
ages
Inscrutable
for
all
my
mind
In
them
I
marvelled
at
the
virtue
And
fashioned
arrogance
that
hurts
you
And
I
confess
from
them
I
fled
It
seemed
with
horror
I
had
read
On
their
foreheads
words
of
Hades
Forever
hopes
you
must
leave
For
them
to
love
yet
meant
to
grieve
To
scare
males
was
joy
for
ages
May
be
you
saw
at
Nevas
banks
Some
ladies
of
these
queer
ranks
XXIII
XXIII
Among
admirers
obedient
Ive
seen
shecranks
of
other
kinds
In
pride
they
were
with
males
indifferent
At
distance
stayed
from
praise
and
sighs
And
I
had
found
then
amazing
By
their
bashful
stern
behaving
They
scared
love
quite
timid
shy
But
they
attracted
lovers
by
At
least
regret
sincere
pity
At
least
by
sounds
of
the
speech
Which
seemed
to
be
more
tender
rich
And
with
the
trustful
blind
entreaty
Some
youthful
lover
ran
again
Behind
the
fuss
but
all
in
vain
XXIV

But
why
Talyana
should
be
guilty
Because
shes
innocent
and
plain
Of
fraud
she
knows
nothing
strictly
And
wants
to
dream
her
life
away
Because
her
love
is
not
of
fashion
Obedient
to
the
call
of
passion
Because
ire
truthfulness
shes
swift
Because
from
heavens
got
as
gift
To
have
some
quick
and
restless
fancy
Because
her
will
and
wit
has
had
And
wayward
willful
is
her
head
Or
heart
is
flaming
tender
healthy
But
cant
you
really
absolve
Her
passions
if
you
them
revolve
XXV

Coquette
is
judging
always
coolly
Tatyana
loves
without
jest
For
love
shes
dedicated
truly
Like
loyal
child
for
mothers
nest
She
doesnt
say
Let
us
postpone
For
multiplying
price
of
own
Attractiveness
to
catch
in
nets
By
first
expressing
some
regret
For
hopes
then
misunderstanding
Well
use
to
break
the
heart
again
Return
him
life
by
jealous
flame
Or
otherwise
the
male
offended
Like
prisoner
from
any
chain
Is
ready
to
escape
again
XXVI

But
l
forsee
some
more
of
bounds
The
honour
of
my
land
to
save
I
have
without
any
doubts
Tatyanas
letter
to
translate
Uneasily
she
was
expressing
Her
thoughts
in
mother
tongue
expressive
Her
Russian
was
yet
very
bad
As
Russian
books
she
never
read
Thats
why
in
French
shes
always
writing
Alas
I
must
repeat
again
A
ladys
love
until
today
To
speak
her
Russian
isnt
trying
And
proud
languages
now
lit
For
prose
postal
a

Today
they
wish
to
make
each
lady
To
read
in
Russian
Whats
the
end
Youll
hardly
meet
today
a
maiden
With
Russian
magazine
in
hand
My
poets
Id
like
to
hear
If
I
am
right
the
ladies
dear
To
whom
in
secret
you
did
write
Some
verse
your
sins
to
justify
To
whom
your
hearts
were
dedicating
In
written
Russian
they
were
bad
As
no
knowledge
they
had
had
And
dearly
were
deformating
The
grammar
language
from
abroad
For
mother
tongue
they
all
had
got
XXVIII

And
God
forbid
at
evening
party
Or
after
ball
at
porch
on
step
To
meet
a
student
while
departing
Or
scholar
wearing
night
cap
I
dont
like
the
Russian
speeches
Without
grammar
incompleteness
As
well
as
lips
without
smile
Perhaps
Ill
grieve
if
in
a
while
Of
younger
beauties
generation
Will
follow
the
journals
call
To
grammar
will
subdue
us
all
To
verse
will
pay
too
much
attention
But
I
it
doesnt
bother
me
To
old
times
Ill
loyal
be

Some
wrong

wry
neglectful
babble
Of
mispronouncing
of
words
Like
long
before
make
heart
my
tremble
And
all
my
soul
always
flirts
To
have
remorse
I
havent

Like
Bogdanovichs
all

Id
like
all
dear

As
well

previous
youthful
sins
But
well
its
time
I
should
be
busy
The
beautys
letter
I
should
use
But
I
am

refuse

The
bard
of

you

Id
trouble
you
for

me
To
make

magic
tuning
Of
beautys
passion
mood
resuming
Some
foreign

she
often
writes
But
where

Come
My

To

give
with

bows
But

Instead

Never

In
hands
I
have
Tatyanas
letter
Its
kept
by
me
with
sacred
sigh
With
secret
grief
I
read
this
matter
While
reading
cannot
put
aside
By
whom
was
tenderness
inspired
With
words
neglectness
whos
admired
And
who
inspired
touching
talk
Which
looks
like
madmans
hearty
mock
Its
both
harmful
and
absorbing
All
that
I
dont
grasp
Lets
read
My
bad
translation
incomplete
Its
like
of
picture
poor
copy
Or
like
of
Freischutz
lovely
tune
But
played
by
pupils
in
a
Fume
Tatyanas
letter
to
Onegin
I
write
to
you
what
more
or
other
To
add
to
all
by
this
is
said
And
now
at
your
will
is
rather
To
punish
me
with
scorn
for
that
But
if
my
wretched
fate
you
rather
Will
grasp
with
pity
little
bit
Youll
never
leave
me
such
unfit
At
first
I
wished
to
keep
it
secret
Believe
me
never
of
my
shame
Youd
guess
as
I
would
well
behave
If
I
had
any
hope
rigid
Not
often
mere
once
a
week
At
you
in
village
have
a
weak
But
look
To
listen
to
your
speaking
A
word
to
say
and
then
again
To
think
arid
think
but
of
the
same
All
day
and
night
until
new
meeting
They
say
you
are
a
lone
guy
In
countrys
stillness
you
are
boring
And
we
with
nothing
can
we
shine
We
all
to
see
you
are
adoring
What
for
you
visited
all
us
In
village
in
forgotten
stillness
Of
you
Id
never
know
thus
I
wouldnt
know
tortures
sleepless
Of
agitated
souls
feelings
With
time
Id
smooth
and
then
might
be
Id
find
a
friend
to
suit
my
soul
Would
be
a
loyal
wife
on
whole
And
virtuous
mother
I
would
be
Some
other
But
to
no
person
In
all
the
world
Id
give
my
heart
Its
all
decided
its
my
version
By
heavens
board
Im
yours
at
heart
My
life
has
been
a
pawn
but
fruitless
Of
meeting
with
my
dear
friend
I
know
you
were
sent
by
goodness
Youll
be
my
guard
until
the
end
You
came
to
me
when
I
was
sleeping
Unseen
you
were
to
me
beloved
Your
glance
made
languish
me
far
love
Your
voice
was
touching
all
my
feeling
For
long
But
that
was
not
a
dreamt
You
came
at
once
I
got
to
know
Inflamed
and
heated
I
was
whole
And
then
I
thought
Hes
now
in
Its
true
to
you
I
had
boon
listening
In
stillness
spoke
you
to
me
When
I
to
wretchers
was
assisting
Or
by
the
prayer
was
releasing
From
stress
my
soul
within
me
That
instant
I
could
trunk
with
reason
That
you
had
come
my
dear
vision
In
darkness
came
for
head
of
bed
And
stilly
neared
me
in
calmness
I
think
its
you
with
love
and
brightness
Could
whisper
full
of
hopes
word
What
are
you
angel
guardian
trusty
Or
tempter
treacherous
and
ghastly
You
help
my
doubts
to
resolve
Well
may
he
all
it
is
by
now
The
fraud
of
innocent
young
girl
For
changes
fated
anyhow
Let
it
be
so
you
have
had
In
hands
my
fate
for
ever
now
In
front
of
you
I
tears
shed
Defend
my
soul
anyhow
Imagine
Im
alone
thus
From
no
man
have
understanding
It
seems
to
me
my
wit
is
fading
And
silently
I
perish
must
I
wait
with
glance
when
you
approach
Some
hopes
give
to
poor
heart
Or
heavy
dream
you
stop
by
hard
Alas
deserved
by
me
reproach
I
stop
I
dread
to
read
again
In
fear
shameful
heart
is
sinking
For
me
your
honour
is
the
bail
I
trust
you
bravely
all
my
feeling

Tatyana
now
sighs
and

The

trembling
on

The

on

Inflamed
by

rigid
tongue
Her
head
to

inclining
Her

sliding
From

But
now

the

Light

By

the

To
little

By

A

At

Tatyanas
standing
Shes
breathing
at
the

And
lost

With

filled

What
chatters
Blood
in

runs
cold
They
rush
into
the
yard
at
once
Ah
Eugene
She
is
quickly
running
Like
shade
shes
prompt
to
exits
jumping
From
porch
for
garden
through
the
yard
She
flies
to
look
yet
back
its
hard
In
short
a
minute
shes
been
racing
Across
the
bridges
and
the
glade
Along
the
forest
brook
the
lake
She
is
the
lilac
bushes
breaking
Through
flowers
she
runs
in
wrench
Without
breath
she
reached
a
bench

Has
fallen

He
thats
Eugene
My
God
what
thoughts
could
come
to
him
Of
tortures
full
her
heart
refuges
The
hopes
of
her
heavy
dream
Shes
trembling
in
the
heat
of
fever
For
him
she
waits
and
doesnt
hear
That
in
the
garden
maidens
sing
While
they
are
gathering
not
seen
In
bushes
berries
they
were
given
To
sing
strict
order
while
they
job
To
make
them
banns
not
to
rob
As
berries
never
could
be
eaten
In
country
they
invented
then
The
way
the
banns
to
defend
Maidens
Song
Maidens
dear
beautiful
We
are
mates
in
friendliness
Let
us
play
inventfully
Lot
us
play
more
happily
Let
us
sing
in
gaiety
Song
of
maidens
intimate
Lets
attract
brave
fellow
To
the
chorus
merriful
When
we
get
that
fellow
When
we
see
him
instantly
Lets
away
get
rapidly
Him
bespatter
easily
With
the
berries
laughingly
Dont
hear
secretly
Maidens
singing
intimate
Dont
peep
invisibly
At
the
games
of
maidenhood
XL

But
shes
neglectful
to
the
singing
To
ringing
voices
of
the
maids
She
waits
impatiently
for
feeling
That
hearty
tremble
now
fades
That
gets
away
of
cheecks
the
flaming
Her
breast
as
yet
is
greatly
trembling
But
doesnt
lade
the
heat
of
cheeks
And
brighter
strickingly
it
heats
As
well
as
poor
moth
is
blending
And
shines
like
rainbowed
a
thing
When
him
a
schoolboy
clips
the
wing
Or
like
a
little
hares
trembling
When
sees
a
hunter
from
afar
At
him
is
looking
so
far

At
last
shes
very
deeply
sighing
From
little
bench
is
getting
is
going
and
when
shes
trying
To
turn
aside
is
coming
up
Just
He
His
gaze
on
her
hes
fixing
Like
dreadful
shade
for
her
hes
reaching
And
she
as
if
shes
burned
by
flame
Has
stopped
at
once
and
looks
away
But
sequels
of
the
sudden
meeting
Today
my
dear
readerfriend
I
cannot
show
to
the
end
As
I
must
go
after
speaking
To
have
a
rest
and
have
a
hike
Thats

Ill
finish

As
science
of

its

Of

That
was
the
way
of
Eugenes
thinking
In
his
first
youth
he
was
untrained
Was
victim
of
the
wild
misleading
Of
big
his
passions
unrestrained
By
habits
of
the
life
hes
pampered
By
somebody
he
was
well
tempered
But
others
made
him
disappoint
The
slow
languid
was
the
point
Hes
languished
by
the
hits
rebuffing
Attentive
in
the
still
and
noise
To
protests
of
souls
voice
Suppressed
his
yawning
by
his
laughing
Eight
years
did
he
kill
these
ways
And
thus
he
lost
of
prime
young
days
X
X
He
ceased
to
fall
in
love
with
beauties
And
dangled
after
like
the
rest
Himself
consoled
if
not
suited
Betrayed
was
glad
to
have
a
rest
He
looked
for
girls
without
passion
And
left
them
all
with
none
compassion
Did
not
remember
love
and
spite
Behaved
like
some
indifferent
guy
For
evening
whist
whos
coming
briskly
Sits
down
plays
not
very
hard
Then
gets
he
out
of
the
yard
At
home
falls
asleep
too
quickly
At
dawn
who
never
knows
yet
The
evening
where
will
he
spend
XI

Onegin
got
Tatyanas
message
It
quickly
touched
his
souls
strings
For
all
his
thoughts
it
was
a
passage
Unusual
tongue
of
maidens
dreams
In
thoughts
her
face
too
pale
he
found
She
often
seemed
to
be
cast
down
And
into
sweet
and
sinless
dream
By
soul
he
was
getting
in
Of
old
times
the
heat
of
feeling
May
be
could
capture
for
a
while
He
didnt
want
to
cheat
meanwile
The
trusting
heart
of
pure
being
For
garden
now
we
shall
fleet
In
which
shes
got
with
him
to
meet
XII

Some
minutes
they
were
silent
both
Onegin
then
to
her
came
up
And
told
her
To
me
you
wrote
Do
not
deny
Ive
read
it
up
Of
trusting
soul
hard
confessions
Of
pure
love
such
good
expressions
I
can
your
frankness
estimate
It
made
my
feelings
agitate
And
passions
which
were
mute
and
heartless
To
praise
yet
you
l
dont
want
For
it
I
shall
repay
a
lot
By
my
admission
truly
artless
All
my
confessions
must
you
take
For
judgement
yours
I
give
my
fate
XIII

If
I
would
wish
to
have
restricted
My
life
by
family
you
see
If
by
my
lot
I
were
convicted
A
husband
father
just
to
be
If
by
the
family
best
vision
For
instant
Id
be
charmed
with
reason
Believe
Id
never
try
anew
To
look
for
better
bride
but
you
Ill
simply
say
without
fevers
If
previous
idol
I
could
find
Alone
you
to
speak
my
mind
Id
take
as
friend
of
days
my
grievous
Of
all
the
charming
for
the
bail
And
would
be
happy
till
I
fail
XI

Im
not
quite
made
to
be
much
happy
My
souls
alien
for
bliss
Perfections
yours
make
speech
my
gappy
Of
them
Im
not
yet
worthy
miss
Believe
for
bail
I
give
my
conscience
The
wedlock
will
be
poignant
nonsense
I
might
be
deeply
loving
you
But
getting
used
Id
run
from
you
Your
tears
if
you
will
be
crying
Would
never
touch
my
gloomy
heart
But
they
would
madden
it
too
hard
What
roses
you
can
be
judging
For
us
fine
Hymen
now
makes
And
maybe
yet
for
many
days

In
all
the
world
its
most
badly
To
see
in
family
the
wife
Whos
waiting
for
her
husband
sadly
Alone
daily
all
her
life
That
she
is
good
dull
husband
knows
But
at
has
fate
he
curses
throws
Hes
always
frowned
taciturn
Hes
chilly
jealous
angry
turned
Thats
what
I
am
Indeed
you
wont
With
all
your
pure
flaming
heart
Be
glad
with
such
a
man
You
smart
With
rare
wit
your
letter
wrote
Indeed
dyou
have
this
kind
of
mate
Destined
to
your
severe
fate
XVI

My
dreams
and
years
wont
rather
Return
to
make
me
new
a
bit
I
love
you
but
with
love
of
brother
And
may
be
tenderer
indeed
You
listen
but
without
anger
With
time
young
girl
will
change
her
temper
Her
easy
dreams
by
other
dreams
As
well
as
trees
can
change
the
leaves
In
early
spring
of
every
year
You
see
by
skies
its
predestined
Youll
fall
in
love
once
more
and
find
You
learn
to
rule
yourself
I
fear
Not
any
man
can
grasp
such
things
Ignorance
many
troubles
brings

This
way
my
Eugene
was
her
teaching
Through
tears
never
seeing
him
Without
breath
with
timid
feeling
Tatyana
listened
then
to
him
He
gave
his
hard
in
all
her
grievance
As
they
would
say
it
was
unwitnessed
Tatyana
silently
curl
lean
Her
languid
head
she
bent
to
him
Through
kitchengarden
they
went
home
They
came
together
no
one
Did
try
to
make
of
that
some
fun
The
countrys
freedom
has
its
own
And
happy
rights
for
own
self
Like
haughty
Moscow
itself
XVIII
XVIII
And
you
agree
my
dear
reader
This
time
like
real
gentleman
With
dear
Tanya
he
was
eager
Himself
to
show
honest
man
Revealed
his
own
soul
simple
Meanwhile
malevolance
of
people
With
him
was
always
on
the
bends
His
enemies
as
well
as
friends
It
is
the
same
for
people
simple
To
curse
him
tried
this
way
and
that
Each
man
has
enemies
but
yet
From
friends
defend
us
God
a
little
Ah
many
friends
were
near
then
With
reason
I
remembered
them
XIX
XIX
And
what
Its
right
I
simply
wrote
Of
idle
blackish
dreams
of
mine
In
brackets
I
would
like
to
note
You
havent
more
insulting
lie
By
liars
secretly
prepared
By
worldly
mob
in
chorus
favoured
And
no
nonsense
in
the
world
Or
epigram
with
brutal
word
Which
friend
of
yours
with
smile
of
terror
In
circles
decent
so
right
Without
purpose
or
a
spite
Would
not
repeat
for
days
in
error
With
might
and
main
hell
you
defend
With
love
of
kinsman
not
of
friend
XX

Hm
hm
You
generous
my
readers
Are
all
your
kinsfolk
okey
You
let
me
now
my
ideas
To
tell
you
all
this
very
day
What
does
the
kinsfolk
mean
namely
It
means
the
following
thing
mainly
We
must
all
time
all
them
caress
Respect
and
love
at
heart
not
less
And
by
the
peoples
usual
custom
On
Christmas
must
we
come
to
see
To
be
the
rest
of
year
free
Congratulations
are
accustomed
We
them
remind
about
us
And
let
them
God
long
live
for
us
XXI

But
then
the
love
of
tender
beauties
More
trusty
is
than
friendship
kin
And
you
have
right
to
it
not
duties
Among
rebellious
storms
I
mean
Its
right
of
course
but
trends
of
fashion
But
of
the
nature
willful
pressure
Opinions
of
the
worldly
might
And
fair
sex
like
downs
slight
Besides
opinions
of
the
husband
By
very
good
and
virtuous
wife
Most
be
respected
for
the
life
And
true
girlfriend
in
loves
adjustment
Sometimes
allured
is
for
days
With
love
the
Satan
jokes
makes
XXII

But
whom
to
love
Whom
youd
be
trusting
Whos
that
which
never
us
betrays
Whos
helpfully
for
us
adjusting
His
own
deeds
and
when
he
prays
Who
helps
from
slander
not
to
perish
Who
carefully
us
can
cherish
To
whom
my
vice
is
not
a
harm
Who
never
bores
us
by
his
charm
By
those
phantoms
he
vain
seeker
Should
not
in
vain
exhaust
himself
You
first
of
alt
must
love
yourself
My
dear
venerable
reader
Such
subjects
worthy
of
your
mind
More
gentle
never
you
will
find

What
was
the
sequence
of
the
meeting
Alas
its
easy
to
divine
Of
love
mad
sufferings
shes
feeling
Without
ceasing
for
a
while
In
young
sad
souls
aspirations
And
yet
much
more
with
dismal
passions
Tatyana
poor
is
in
heat
in
bed
she
never
falls
asleep
The
health
the
prime
of
life
its
sweetness
The
smile
the
innocent
calm
ease
Ali
that
has
gone
like
sounds
fizz
And
dear
Tanyas
youth
all
dwindles
The
shade
of
coming
storm
this
way
Is
darkening
all
the
breaking
day
XXIV

Alas
Tatyanas
daily
fading
Shes
paling
sinking
and
is
mute
Shes
nothing
ever
entertaining
For
life
she
wouldnt
give
a
hoot
All
heads
are
now
grandly
shaking
The
neighbours
whisper
they
are
wailing
Its
time
its
time
to
marry
her
But
its
enough
to
speak
of
her
Id
cheer
up
imagination
By
picture
where
love
yet
strives
Unwittingly
you
see
the
lives
Confuse
yet
me
with
incarnation
Forgive
me
but
my
love
is
deep
To
Tanyas
dear
heart
indeed

Each
minute
more
is
captivated
By
Olgas
beauty
so
young
By
bondage
Lenskys
fascinated
Gave
up
his
soul
to
the
fun
With
her
hes
ever
in
her
chamber
Until
the
daylight
turns
more
fainter
Or
in
the
garden
hand
in
hand
They
walk
at
morning
so
grand
And
what
By
love
intoxicated
Embarrassed
by
the
tender
shame
Sometimes
he
dares
like
in
game
By
smile
of
Olga
animated
To
play
by
her
untwisted
lock
To
kiss
the
edge
of
Olgas
frock

Sometimes
to
Olga
he
is
reading
With
morals
novel
for
herself
Whose
author
bolter
natures
feeling
Than
Chateaubriand
does
himself
Meanwhile
some
two
or
three
of
pages
Some
idle
gibberish
or
fables
But
dangerous
for
the
maidens
heart
Quite
reddenning
hes
missing
up
They
are
alone
far
from
people
Are
playing
at
the
board
of
chess
On
table
leaning
with
slight
press
Are
sitting
lost
in
thought
a
little
And
own
pawn
with
own
rook
Distracted
Lensky

took

When
hes
at
home
always
there
By
Olga
is
he
kept
all
day
Of
album
leaflets
with
his
care
To
decorate
he
works
away
In
them
he
draws
the
country
whole
The
Kyprids
temple
graves
alone
Or
on
the
lyre
draws
a
dove
With
pens
and
paints
with
all
his
love
Or
on
the
leaves
for
recollections
Of
other
signatures
beneath
His
own
tender
verse
he
leaves
Like
monument
to
his
affections
Of
instant
thought
some
slight
a
trace
But
of
the
same
for
years
race

Of
course
for
times
you
have
been
seeing
A
country
maidens
album
big
Which
by
the
girlfriends
had
been
scribbling
From
start
from
end
in
any
twig
In
it
in
spite
of
rules
of
spelling
Excessive
verse
as
they
are
telling
As
sign
of
friendships
written
in
Continued
lessened
for
the
whim
The
first
of
leaflets
just
can
show
Quecrirezvous

Qu'crirezvous

And
on
the
last
one
you
read
so
Anntt
Who
loves
you
more
than
I
can
do
Must
here
write
a
verse
anew

Without
fail
youll
find
them
here
Two
hearts
the
blooms
the
torchs
rays
Youll
find
some
vowes
to
the
dear
To
love
her
until
dying
days
Some
poet
from
ranks
of
army
Signed
verse
of
villaine
though
charming
To
such
an
album
being
tight
If
to
confess
Id
like
to
write
With
all
my
soul
being
sure
That
any
rubbish
done
with
zeal
Will
get
some
favourable
deal
And
afterwards
theyll
not
endure
Maliciously
discuss
with
smiles
If
I
was
sharp
or
dull
in
lies
XXX

But
uncoordinated
volumes
From
devils
library
all
got
And
albums
perfect
but
enormous
Of
stylish
rhymers
racking
lot
You
all
whom
decorated
guickly
Tolstoy
with

such
wondrous
sweatily
Or
Baratinsky
with
his

Let
be

birnt

then
When
some
respiended
dear
lady
To
give

me
yet
tries
inquarto
I
am
engulfed
by
trembling
vice
An
epigram
is
being
ready
At
bottom
of
my
soul
fast
But
give
them
madrigal
at
last
